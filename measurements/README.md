# Measurements

Measurements is a library for computation of physical quantities (time, distances, etc.) in Elixir
A quantity is represented by a struct with a value, a unit and an error.

Error is propagated through calculations, and unit prevent collision of unrelated quantities.
Automatic conversion of unit is supported.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis as reference.

Dimensions supported:
- [X] Time (T)
- [ ] Length (L)
- [ ] Mass (M)
- [ ] Electric Current (I)
- [ ] Absolute Temperature (Î˜)
- [ ] Amount of Substance (N)
- [ ] Luminous Intensity (J)
